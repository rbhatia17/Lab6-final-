In the tableau dashboard i found the ranking of santa clara university in bay area and it comes to be number one, and then i did the comparison of the placements of the alumni from the unviersities and the placement of SCU is better then any other university. I did the salary pay analaysis of two universities that is top 2 in bay area and scu has a good salary pay and a good salary growth as well. 
For the recruiters they might look for MSIS skill sets and the companies the students are working and by the salary they will get an idea what is the range of the salaries the students of SCU get.

# Improvements
I would like to gather more data to support my analysis for recruiters, and make it more interactive by providing them options of which area they want to stay and accordingly which is the best university for them and other factors they would consider.
